# Work in progress / Proof of Concept #
Will likely have lots of bugs!

## Uses heuristics ##
This package uses heuristics to find function definitions. This means it will
_not_ handle every possible case, do not be surprised if it fails to find a
function definition, particularly if it uses MACROS or C++ templates.
